# IOT-Air-Quality-Monitoring-System
In this project,we used hardware components like mq-135 gas sensor,nodemcu esp8266,breadboard and jumping wires.
Mq-135 gas sensor detects various gases like alcohol,smoke,C02 etc.
Gas detection in ppm is done using mq135 external labriry.
The air quality in ppm is shown on a serial monitor of arduino ide and uploaded on thingspeak cloud platform which visualize in a graph
